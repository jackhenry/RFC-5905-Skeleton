### RFC 5905 Appendix C Skeleton Program

This is the source code provided in appendix C of [RFC 5905](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5905). 

This code has not been compiled or executed. As described in the document, it is not meant to be a full program but rather a guideline for implementing the NTPv4 protocol. I simply copied the source code into .c files in order to improve readability/navigation.
